A work-in-progress improved version of rajatady's Woocommerce Client for Android. Till now it has been very difficult to create Android Apps using WooCommerce as a backend. With the advent of the WooCommerce Rest API, the WooCommerce team has given the developers a quick and easy way to interact with the world's most popular e-commerce plugin for Wordpress. This library helps in easing things out even further. Don't take my word for it. Just take it for a spin and you will know. 

# How To Use

1. In your module level/app level build.gradle file, add the following lines

        repositories {
            jcenter()
    
            maven {
                url "https://jitpack.io"
            }   
        }
    
2. Then in dependencies, add the following line to include the library:
  
        dependencies {
            .
            .
            compile 'com.github.rajatady:Woocommerce-Android-Client:0.0.3'
        }
3. Sync the project with the gradle files. The library should be imported to your project.
4. Create a new Java Class which extends the Application Class or if you already have one created, just put the following lines in there.
    
        public class Aadira extends Application {

                @Override
                public void onCreate() {
                    super.onCreate();
        
                    .
                    .
                    .
                    
                    WCBuilder builder = new WCBuilder();
                    
                    //Whether your website has https
                    builder.setIsHttps(false); 
                    
                    // Set the website URL
                    builder.setBaseUrl("your.websiteurl.here");
                    
                    // Signing method. Can be one of HMACSHA1 or HMACSHA256
                    builder.setSigning_method(SigningMethod.HMACSHA1);
                    
                    // your woocommerce api key
                    builder.setWc_key("key here");
                    
                    // your woocommerce api secret
                    builder.setWc_secret("secret here");
                    
                    WooCommerce.getInstance().initialize(builder);
                    .
                    .
                }
        }
    
5. Just get an instance of the Woocommerce Class hereon like this
      
        
        WooCommerce wooCommerce = WooCommerce.getInstance();
